# Light Field Style Transfer With Local Angular Consistency
Implementation of Light Field Style Transfer with Local Angular Consistency


## Light field conventions

## Metrics
We also provide MATLAB scripts for the LFEC metric [] and our proposed LFAC metric. 

### Light Field Angular Consistency (LFAC) metric

### Light Field Epipolar Consistency (LFEC) metric
